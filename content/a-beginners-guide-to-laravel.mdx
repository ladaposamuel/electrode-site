# Skipping the Docs: A Beginner's Guide to Getting Started with Laravel

Are you a beginner feeling overwhelmed by Laravel's official documentation? Don't worry, you're not alone. While Laravel is known for its excellent documentation, sometimes it can be a bit much for newcomers. The good news is that there are several alternative ways to dive into Laravel that might be more beginner-friendly. Let's explore some of these options!

## 1. Laravel Bootcamp: Learn by Doing

If you're the type who learns best by diving right in, the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/) is an excellent place to start. Here's why it's great for beginners:

- Hands-on approach: You'll build a real project from scratch.
- Step-by-step guidance: Clear instructions that are easy to follow.
- Covers the basics: Learn fundamental Laravel concepts as you go.

The Laravel bootcamp is designed to get you up and running quickly, without getting bogged down in theory.
 It's a perfect starting point for those who want to see results fast.

## 2. Video Tutorials: Visual Learning at Its Best

For visual learners, video tutorials can be a game-changer. Two great resources stand out:

### Laracasts

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) is often considered the go-to resource for Laravel learners. Here's why it's worth checking out:

- High-quality, professional tutorials
- Covers everything from basics to advanced topics
- Engaging teaching style that keeps you motivated

### YouTube

Don't underestimate the power of free YouTube tutorials. Many skilled developers share their knowledge on this platform. Some popular channels to check out include:

- Traversy Media
- Codecourse
- Laravel Daily

Remember to look for recent videos to ensure you're learning the most up-to-date practices.

## 3. GitHub: Learn from Real-World Examples

Sometimes, the best way to learn is by examining real-world code. GitHub is a treasure trove of Laravel projects. Here's how to make the most of it:

1. Search for "Laravel projects" or "Laravel examples" on GitHub.
2. Look for repositories with good documentation and README files.
3. Clone a project and try to understand how it works.
4. Experiment by making small changes and seeing the results.

This hands-on approach can help you understand how Laravel is used in practice.

## 4. Local Development Environment: Herd to the Rescue

Setting up a development environment can be a hurdle for beginners. That's where Herd comes in. As mentioned in the my post here - [Herd - A MacOS PHP development Server
](https://www.electrode.dev/blog/herd-macos-localhost-server), Herd is a local dev environment built specifically for Laravel on macOS which is also now available for windows users. It simplifies the setup process, allowing you to focus on learning Laravel rather than wrestling with configuration.

## Conclusion

While the official Laravel documentation is comprehensive and valuable, it's not the only path to learning this powerful framework. By using resources like the Laravel Bootcamp, video tutorials, GitHub examples, and tools like Herd, you can find a learning method that suits your style and gets you building with Laravel in no time.

Remember, the key is to start building something. Don't get caught up in trying to learn everything at once. Pick a project, start coding, and learn as you go. Before you know it, you'll be navigating Laravel like a pro!

Happy coding!
