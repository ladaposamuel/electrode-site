### My Journey in Managing Projects with Multiple PHP Versions on MacOS


```bash
#!/bin/bash
function switchphp() {
  brew unlink php@"$1" && brew link --force php@"$2"
}
```

However, this approach was not optimal, as there are more effective ways to
handle this problem. For instance, if you have both versions installed via
Homebrew, you can use the following commands:

```bash
brew unlink php@7.4
brew link php@7.3

### Introducing Laravel Herd

During Laravel US 2023 in Nashville, Taylor Otwell introduced a groundbreaking
tool named Laravel Herd. You can watch the announcement
[here](https://youtu.be/1P3wLy49t2c?si=kR87XYsOH5yJa35B&t=795).

Laravel Herd is a lightning-fast, native Laravel and PHP development environment
designed for macOS. It encompasses everything necessary to kickstart Laravel
development, including PHP and Nginx. With Herd installed, you're equipped to
embark on Laravel projects effortlessly.

Apart from [Laragon](https://laragon.org/index.html), Laravel Herd has emerged
as one of the most exceptional local development tools, particularly for MacOS.
To learn more about it, visit the [official
documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/herd).

### Setting Up Herd

> Note: Previously, I relied on Laravel Valet as my primary local development
> tool. Transitioning to the new Laravel Herd was a smooth process. After
> installing Herd, it promptly listed all my projects, enabling me to start
> using it right away.

The installation process for Herd is straightforward. You can download it from
the [Laravel Herd website](https://herd.laravel.com/) and follow the
installation instructions.

That's it! You're now ready to make the most of Herd. It will automatically
display all your projects, PHP versions, and a feature called
[expose](https://expose.dev/)â€”an alternative to
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)â€”which allows you to expose your local development
server to the internet.

Here's how convenient it has become for me to switch between PHP versions and
upgrade to the latest one. ðŸ˜€ ![Switching PHP
