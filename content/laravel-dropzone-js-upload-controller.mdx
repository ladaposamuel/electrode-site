## Introduction

Dropzone.js is a JavaScript library that provides drag and drop file uploads
with image previews. It’s lightweight, doesn’t depend on any other library
(like jQuery) and is highly customizable.

In this tutorial I'm going to walk you through how I setup and use Dropzone.js
with Laravel. I'm going to assume you already have a Laravel application up
and running and plan to integrate Dropzone.js into an existing form.

## Prequities

- Dropzone.js CSS
- Dropzone.js JS
- jQuery
- An existing Laravel application

## Installation

Using it's CDN is the easiest way to get started with Dropzone.js. Just add the following script tag to your blade partials:

Script:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropzone/4.2.0/min/dropzone.min.js"></script>
```

CSS:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropzone/4.2.0/min/dropzone.min.css"
/>
```

## Usage

Dropzone.js is a breeze to set up. First, add two API routes to your `web.php` file to handle the file uploads and deletions:

web.php

```php
    Route::post('/file/upload/', 'FileUploadController@upload');
    Route::post('/file/delete_upload/', 'FileUploadController@delete_upload');
```

Next, add the following HTML to your file upload page where the upload form is
located. This will create a dropzone area where users can drag and drop files
to upload. It will also create a hidden input field that will store the file
names of the uploaded files. This is useful if you want to save the file names
to a database table.

```html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div class="control-group">
    <label class="control-label" for="period">Invoices</label>
    <div class="controls">
      <div class="form-group dropzone" id="dZUpload"></div>
      <div id="image_gallery"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```

Next, add the following JavaScript to your file upload page. This will initialize the dropzone area and handle the file uploads and deletions.

````html
<script>
  Dropzone.options.dZUpload = {
    headers: { "X-CSRF-TOKEN": $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr("content") },
    url: "{{ url()->current() }}/upload",
    autoProcessQueue: true,
    uploadMultiple: true,
    dictDefaultMessage:
      "<h4>Drop files here or click to upload document(s)<h4>",
    parallelUploads: 5,
    maxFiles: 5,
    maxFilesize: 20000,
    acceptedFiles: "image/*,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.odt,.rtf,.docx",
    addRemoveLinks: true,
    removedfile: function (file) {
      var name = file.name;
      $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        headers: {
          "X-CSRF-TOKEN": $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr("content"),
        },
        url: "{{ url()->current() }}/delete_upload",
        data: "id=" + name,
        dataType: "html",
      });
      var _ref;
      return (_ref = file.previewElement) != null
        ? _ref.parentNode.removeChild(file.previewElement)
        : void 0;
    },
    success: function (file, response) {
      $("#uploadedImages").val(response);
    },
    error: function (file, response) {
      file.previewElement.classList.add("dz-error");
    },
  };
</script>
````

Finally, add the following controller methods to handle the file uploads and deletions:

```php
    public function upload(Request $request)
    {
        $file = $request->file('file');
        $filename = $file->getClientOriginalName();
        $file->move(public_path('uploads'), $filename);
        return response()->json($filename);
    }

    public function delete_upload(Request $request)
    {
        $filename = $request->get('id');
        $path = public_path() . '/uploads/' . $filename;
        if (file_exists($path)) {
            unlink($path);
        }
        return $filename;
    }
```

That's it! You should now have a working file upload form that uses Dropzone.js.

## Conclusion

Dropzone.js is a great library for handling file uploads. It's lightweight, easy to use and highly customizable. I hope this tutorial has helped you get started with Dropzone.js and Laravel. If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below.
