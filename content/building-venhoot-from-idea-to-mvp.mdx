## Introduction
As a developer living in a residential area with limited local shopping options,
I found myself increasingly turning to online shopping, particularly on Instagram. 
The platform's visual nature and features like collections made it perfect for browsing and saving items for future purchase.
However, my experiences with Instagram vendors were mixed. While some were excellent, others proved unreliable. 
One particularly frustrating incident involved a four-month wait for a flower glass pot, with the vendor consistently breaking promises while advertising quick delivery to new customers. My attempts to warn others were thwarted by comment deletions and blocks.
This experience highlighted a crucial gap: the need for a platform where online shoppers could share their experiences with social media vendors. Traditional social media didn't offer the right framework for such reviews to reach a wide, relevant audience.
That's when the idea for Venhoot was born â€“ an online platform where customers can rate and review businesses that sell through social media. It aims to provide transparency and accountability in the growing world of social commerce.
Venhoot's mission is simple yet powerful: to empower online shoppers with the information they need to make informed decisions, while also encouraging vendors to maintain high standards of service.
