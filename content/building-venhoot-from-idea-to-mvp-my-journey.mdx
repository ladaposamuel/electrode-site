As a developer residing in an area with limited local shopping options, I found myself increasingly reliant on online shopping,
particularly through Instagram. The platform's visual appeal and features like collections made it ideal for browsing
and bookmarking items. However, my experiences with Instagram vendors were decidedly mixed.

While some vendors provided excellent service, others proved unreliable. A particularly frustrating incident
involved a four-month wait for a flower glass pot. The vendor repeatedly broke promises while continuing to advertise
quick delivery to new customers. My attempts to warn potential buyers were met with comment deletions and account blocks.

This experience highlighted a critical gap in the market: the lack of a dedicated platform for online shoppers to share
their experiences with social media vendors.
Traditional social media platforms weren't designed to host and disseminate such reviews effectively.


## The Solution: Venhoot


This realization led to the conception of Venhoot â€“
> an online platform where customers can rate and review businesses that operate through social media.

Venhoot aims to introduce transparency and accountability to the rapidly growing world of social commerce.


Venhoot's had two primary goals:
1. To empower online shoppers with the information they need to make informed decisions.
2. To encourage vendors to maintain high standards of service through public accountability.

## The Development Journey



### Technical Foundations

The journey from idea to MVP began with setting up the project's foundation.
I chose Laravel as the backend framework for its robustness and extensive ecosystem.
The initial commit, made on April 4, 2023, marked the beginning of this exciting journey:

I love and enjoy working with Laravel, and it was a no-brainer when I was making the decision to use it for this project.

To develop an MVP quickly, I decided to use [Boostrap](https://getbootsrap.com) (also my favourite) to setup the interface.


In a week, I completed the landing page, created the controllers and routes, a few views, and a basic database structure.
