PHPstorm has always been my favorite IDE and I have been using it for more than 5 years now. I have tried other IDEs like VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc. but I always come back to PHPstorm. It has a lot of features and shortcuts that make my life easier. I am going to share my top 10 most used shortcuts and habits that I use in PHPstorm.


## 1. Search Everywhere
By pressing `Shift` twice, you can search for anything in PHPstorm. You can search for files, classes, methods, actions, etc. It is the most used shortcut for me. I use it to open files, search for classes, methods, etc. It is a very powerful feature and I use it all the time.

## 2. Search for files
You can search for files by pressing `Shift + Command + O` on Mac and `Shift + Ctrl + N` on Windows. It is a very useful shortcut and I use it all the time to open files.
