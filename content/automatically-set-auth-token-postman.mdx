In this article, we’ll walk through how to automate the process of setting the `access_token` returned from an `/auth/login` API request into an environment variable using Postman. 
This is a super handy technique that simplifies working with authenticated APIs.

## Why Automate Token Handling in Postman?

When testing APIs, you often need to authenticate via an API, and in return, you'll receive an `access_token` that you’ll use for subsequent requests. Manually copying and pasting this token across multiple requests can be tedious, especially when tokens expire frequently.

With Postman, you can leverage **post-request scripts** to automatically extract the token from the response and store it as an **environment variable** for easy access. Let's walk through how to do this.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Your API Request

First, create your `/auth/login` request in Postman. This request will handle your authentication, and the server will return a response containing the `access_token`. A typical login response might look like this:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "statusCode": 201,
    "path": "/auth/login",
    "data": {
        "access_token": "your-jwt-token-here"
    }
}
```

### 2. Writing the Post-Request Script

Now, we’ll use a **post-request script** to extract the token from the response and save it in an environment variable named `{{token}}`.

1. Go to the **Tests** tab in your Postman request.
2. Add the following code in the script area:

```javascript
// Parse the response body
let jsonResponse = pm.response.json();

// Check if the request was successful and contains the access token
if (jsonResponse.success && jsonResponse.data.access_token) {
    // Set the access_token in the environment variable "token"
    pm.environment.set("token", jsonResponse.data.access_token);
    console.log("Token has been set: " + jsonResponse.data.access_token);
} else {
    console.log("Token not found or request failed.");
}
```

### 3. What Does the Script Do?

- **pm.response.json()**: This function parses the JSON response body returned by the `/auth/login` request.
- **Condition Check**: We check if the response is successful (`jsonResponse.success === true`) and if the `access_token` exists in the response (`jsonResponse.data.access_token`).
- **Set Environment Variable**: If both conditions are met, the script sets the environment variable `{{token}}` using `pm.environment.set("token", jsonResponse.data.access_token)`.
- **Console Logging**: For debugging purposes, the token is logged to the console. You can access this via **View > Show Postman Console** in the Postman UI.

### 4. Using the `{{token}}` Variable in Future Requests

Once the token is set in the environment, you can easily reference it in any subsequent request. For example, in the headers of an authenticated request, you can set the `Authorization` header like so:

```
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
```

Postman will automatically replace `{{token}}` with the value stored by the script after the login request.

## Full Example

Here’s a full example setup for your `/auth/login` request:

```json
POST /auth/login
{
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
}
```

In the **Tests** tab:

```javascript
let jsonResponse = pm.response.json();
if (jsonResponse.success && jsonResponse.data.access_token) {
    pm.environment.set("token", jsonResponse.data.access_token);
    console.log("Token has been set: " + jsonResponse.data.access_token);
} else {
    console.log("Token not found or request failed.");
}
```

Now, in any other request, you can use the token by referencing `{{token}}` in your headers.

### Conclusion

Using post-request scripts in Postman is an incredibly powerful way to streamline API testing, especially when working with tokens. Instead of manually copying tokens from one request to another, you can automate the process, saving time and reducing errors. Try setting this up in your workflow and experience the efficiency boost firsthand!
