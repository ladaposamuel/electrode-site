## Introduction

A simple script to complete Laravel deployment on CPANEL, it will auto copy 
public folder to public_html and clear cache

### Prerequisites

- A server with CPANEL
- A Laravel project
- SSH access to the server
- GIT already setup on the server

### Deployment

I work with PHP and Laravel on a daily basis, for both personal projects,
freelance work for clients, and at my job. I have a few different servers and 
most of them are on CPANEL. I have been using CPANEL for a long time and I
have been using it for deployment as well. I have been using the same script
for a long time and I thought it would be a good idea to share it with you.

### Setup

First, you need to create a new file in the root of your project and name it
`deploy.sh` and add the following code to it.


### The script

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Change to the project directory.
cd ~/app

# SSH agent setup
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/main

# Pull the latest changes from the git repository
git pull

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:cache
php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Delete the content of ~/demo.venhoot.com
rm -rf ~/public_html/website.com/*

# Copy the contents of ~/app/public to ~/demo.venhoot.com
cp -R ~/app/public/* ~/public_html/website.com/

echo "Deployment script completed successfully."

```


To run this script, you need to have SSH access to your server and GIT already
setup on the server.

- Make the Script Executable: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the following command to make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x deploy.sh
    ```

- Run the Script: To run the script, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
